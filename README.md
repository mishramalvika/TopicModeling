# Temporal Analysis of Research in Computational Economics using Topic Models
The academic publishing world is changing significantly, with ever-growing numbers of publications 
each year and shifting publishing patterns. Interacting with large text data sets is often posed as a 
needle in a haystack problem. The discipline of information retrieval is built upon systematizing, 
solving, and evaluating the problem of finding a document that matches the user query, the document 
that best represents a concept, or the answer to a question. Another related problem is of understanding 
large document collections, the solution to which is not building an extensive categorization scheme 
as that requires a significant investment of time and resources. 

Topic modeling is a tool to picture how humans and computers understand the underlying content 
and sense of a document. Once trained, they provide a framework for humans to understand document 
collections both directly by “reading” models or indirectly by using topics as input variables for 
further analysis. This research presents a temporal analysis of the scientific research done in the past 
30 years in the Computational Economics domain. 

The aim of this work has been to identify and analyze temporal trends of the latent themes in the papers 
published in Springer’s journal, Computational Economics, and ACM’s conference, Economics and 
Computation. The research initiated with collecting data by web scraping techniques and preprocessing 
it for the natural language processing task of topic modeling. This was followed by the application and 
comparison of three popular models, Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and 
BERTopic. The topics and their distribution over time was mapped as the proportion of documents that 
belong to each topic every year. To further investigate the temporal trends, the increase index was 
calculated for each topic, based on which the topics were categorized as Hot and Cold topics. 

This research presents a comprehensive and systematic approach to analyzing the latent themes in 
computational economics research, which can be applied to other research domains. The importance of 
using advanced natural language processing techniques, such as web scraping and topic modeling, to 
identify latent themes in large datasets is highlighted in this work. The results provide significant insights 
into the temporal trends of the identified topics and shed light on the most prominent and popular research 
domains in computational economics over the past two decades. This can enable the stakeholders of this 
domain to predict the direction in which the field may evolve in the future. This information is essential 
for prioritizing research funding and directing research efforts towards areas of high impact and potential.
